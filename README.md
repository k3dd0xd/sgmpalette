# Skullgirls Mobile Palette Editor

A palette editor for the static sprites of Skullgirls Mobile.

Static sprites consist of portraits, card art, and art for special moves and blockbusters.

A big thanks to Discord user Pupix#0001 for showing me where to find the raw sprites from which this entire project is based on.

Don't expect to be able to perfectly recreate official palettes like Doublicious or Tomb & Gloom. The game uses more complex and more refined blend modes than the ones available here.

Also, unlike my previous Skullgirls Mobile projects, I did not take any steps to make this website mobile-friendly. The color picker on most mobile browsers is too limited anyway.

## Features

### Menu

To load sprites, you must choose a character from the menu.
You can also toggle visibility of the background layer, linework layer, and detail layer here.

### Spritesheet

The spritesheet contains all in-game static sprites of the chosen character.
You can click within any sprite to select a color area to edit.
The color picker for the selected area will be automatically opened.
To disable this, toggle the `Auto Color Picker` button in the palette section.

### Palette

The palette contains all colors present in the chosen character's spritesheet.
Some characters have sprites with noisy edges and thus have extraneous rows of color.

The leftmost button in a row indicates whether the color area is opaque (detail layer applies shadows) or transparent (detail layer is an alpha channel).
The other options in the row indicate color and uniform opacity.

The `Matte` and `Shiny` options at the top denote how the detail layer is blended with the color layer.
`Matte` is essentially linear burn and `Shiny` is basically color dodge.

At the bottom of the palette section, you can load and save palette files.
Palette files are 16x16px images, though the website allows loading images with different dimensions.

## Download

To download a single sprite, right-click (or control-click) a sprite and select `Save Image As...`.

To download a zipped folder of all sprites in the current spritesheet, click the `Download` button at the very bottom of the page.

Thanks to the following:

* [Stuk/jszip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip) for making it easy to create zip files
* [eligrey/FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) for making it easy to download those zip files

The card art sprites can be uploaded to the [SGM Card Creator](https://github.com/Krazete/sgmcard), which should detect it based on its dimensions and automatically set the optimal position parameters.
